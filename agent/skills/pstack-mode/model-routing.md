# pstack-mode — model/role routing (optional)

Entirely optional. Only relevant if your agent runner can dispatch
different sub-tasks to different models or sub-agents. If you're running
as a single model with no sub-agent capability, delete this file — the
rest of pstack-mode doesn't depend on it.

The original pstack read a Cursor-specific rule file
(`~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc`) to map roles to model slugs. This
is the generic replacement: a plain table your agent (or you) can edit.
If a role has no model assigned, just use whatever model is currently
running — don't block on this file being filled in.

| Role                          | Suggested kind of model            | Model to use (fill in) |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Mechanical / precisely-specified code | fast, cheap model                | |
| Judgment calls, prose, review  | strongest reasoning model available | |
| Review panel (if running multiple reviewers) | 2–4 different models/model families | |

Guidance carried over from the original: don't route everything to the
strongest model by default — mechanical, precisely-specified code is
cheaper and just as reliable on a fast model, and saves your strongest
model's budget for the judgment calls that actually need it.
